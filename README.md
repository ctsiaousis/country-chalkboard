## Reflection

This was a two week long project built during my 2022 vacation. The goal was to initially deploy it as a static website that
utilizes **Github Pages** and can be *forked* by anyone to post their trips/vacation etc. I might sometime create a propr 
web application for it with users, online edit, commenting, notifications and so on.
